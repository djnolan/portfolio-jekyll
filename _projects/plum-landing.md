Plum Landing aims to teach kids about ecosystems through videos, games and hands-on activities. I was part of the team that created the brand and designed the digital experiences—while I was a design manager at WGBH Digital. My role on the project was to oversee the other web and game designers, create the visual brand system, design the website and initiate the game design and prototyping process. We worked with Global Mechanic who created the characters and animation—much of the inspiration for the digital brand came from their initial character design and illustration work.

## Logo Design
I tend to think logos do not have to tell you what a brand is about. They need to be simple, memorable marks that can act as the personality of a brand. Most importantly, they need to be versatile and integrate with all the complex variations in a brand system. In other words, logos are usually viewed within the context of some more complicated experience: a website, a game, a billboard whizzing past you, and they're almost always surrounded by other content competing for your attention.

I pushed for a simple Plum Landing logo, and I lost that battle. The executive producers wanted the logo to describe what the project was about in picture form, and they wanted it to include the main character. So we ended up with an earth and the main character, Plum, on top. And there's an arrow going around the earth to represent the kids travelling to different places around the world. Yes, it's very literal and somewhat complex for a logo, but I think it turned out well and has held up nicely in various applications.

I created custom lettering for the logo. Most of the shapes and buttons in the brand are blobby and bubbly—this comes from the blobby, morphing, bean-shaped body of Plum, the alien main character. So the lettering was inspired by her design.

Here are some early iterations of letter and shape options:

One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
