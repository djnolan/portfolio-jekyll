[Spot the Illegal Police Stop](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/quiz-spot-the-illegal-police-stop/) is a text-based quiz with illustrations that asks the user to identify scenarios as constitutional or not. I initiated this project by researching Supreme Court case law, which the examples are based on. The reporter on my team then worked through the editorial details as I started the HTML and CSS, and tackled the main challenge on this project: the illustrations. 

<div class="inline inline--column">
	<img class="border" src="../img/police_d.jpg">
</div>

The art had to srike the right tone for content, they had to be factually accurate and abstracted so the details weren't misleading and the drawing style needed to fit with the overall FRONTLINE style while wtill feeling fresh and unique to this feature.

I wrote more about this project and my process over on [Medium](https://medium.com/@nolan5million/designing-a-quiz-about-police-e64a7429831b#.st5w0of39).
