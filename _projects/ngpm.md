I spent the better part of three years figuring out how to teach math to preshoolers using iPads in the classroom. Our goal was to design a preschool curriculum supplement that would feature eight iPad games, a teacher's guide and additional hands-on activities. In order to reach that goal our team would have to rethink the way we approached making educational games.

WGBH, partnering with two other companies, was awarded a grant from the National Science Foundation to research and design a curriculum exploring tablet devices in preschool classrooms. I was part of the team at WGBH Digital making websites and games for kids. When we started digging into this project it was around 2011 and was still early days for the iPad. We were experts at making small educational web games for kids but 4-year-olds using iPads in a classroom was mostly uncharted territory.

Something quick about subitizing and equipartitioning here?

My role on the project, and the research partners. 

We decided to focus our efforts on an iterative prototyping process where we could learn a lot very quickly and make more informed decisions moving forward. We created dozens of testable prototypes and put them in front of kids. During the height of this prototyping phase we were in the classroom nearly every week testing a new game mechanic. 

## Sketching Unique Game Mechanics

Everything started with the game mechanic. We obsessed over what might be the most engaging interactions, and the ones that could teach the math concepts the best. We were steeped in research and literature about how kids at this age learn math. Our focus was first on sketching out and prototyping the core game mechanic itself, the rest of the game would fall into place later, once the core mechanic was tested and proven effective. 

## Prototyping and Kid Testing

A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.

His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.

One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.

## Refining the Game Experience

He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.
