[The Last Generation](http://apps.frontline.org/the-last-generation/) is an interactive documentary about the threat that climate change poses to a vulnerable island nation and the people who live there. The project was written and produced by Michelle Mizner (link) and Katie Worth (link). They went to the Marshall Islands in 2017 as video producer and reporter—they talked with children there about their life and their plans for the future. We crafted an experience that tells their story.

## The Story

We framed the story of climate change on the Marshall Islands through the lens of three kids living there. 

Izerman: His personality is rooted in the present and his family is considering whether or not to stay on the island—we look at how sea level rise is affecting the island now. 

Julia: She feels a deep connection to an island she's never been to. Her ancestors had to leave their home island in the 1940s so the United States could conduct nuclear testing there. We explore this history and the impact it still has on the Marshall Islands today. 

Wilmer: He is dedicated to preserving the Marshall Islands and planning for his future there. We look at the projections for sea level rise in the 21st century and how long Wilmer's generation has to live there.

## The Experience

Our team decided that an interactive documentary experience would work well to immerse the audience into the video while allowing the opportunity to lean in and dig deeper into complex science information. 

My work on this project started with a phase of early experimentation and prototyping around the structure and flow of the overall experience. Our first prototype was a longform scrolling experience. We learned that the scrolling felt unnecessary because the text was very short and the content for each moment fit nicely on a single screen. We landed on a slideshow format where the user can click and tap to advance or swipe on a desktop trackpad.

{% include inline-col-8.html inline_img='lastgen_narr.jpg' alt='' %}

We combined graphics and animation to explain climate change science and to map out the location of this tiny set of islands in the middle of the Pacific. The islands are actually coral atolls that formed into rings. [more here]

We chose a linear format with moments of interactivity. Image galleries offer a chance to lean in and tap through many examples. Here we're showing efforts on the island to mitigate drought and flooding [CHECK THIS].

Overlay screens provide an opportunity to read about the kids, the islands and the climate science more deeply. These screens allowed us to make some of the more complicated information available to those who had the time an interest to view it, but it doesn't slow down the main experience for those who want to move forward.

## The Visual Design

Our challenge was to come up with a style that could integrate text, video, illustration and data into a seamless and elegant experience. We looked at many directions along the way that could achieve this. 

There was interest early on from the team in exploring a graphic novel approach—one that could integrate illustration and video into a comic-inspired look and feel. We brought on an illustrator who was comfortable working in this style, Erik Nelson Rodriguez (link), to help us explore illustration directions. He and I both worked on illustration and design directions early on.

{% include inline-wide-split.html inline_img1='lastgen_comic1.jpg' inline_img2='lastgen_comic2.jpg' class1='border' class2='border' caption="First image: illustrations by Erik Nelson Rodriguez; second image: illustrations by Dan Nolan." alt1="" alt2="" %}

I continued to develop design directions that combined illustration, photography and video. 

This direction uses photographic textures with simple black silhouette illustrations. The typography has some hand drawn elements but is still clean and condensed.

{% include inline-wide-split.html inline_img1='lastgen_stylev1_1a.jpg' inline_img2='lastgen_stylev1_1b.jpg' caption="Izerman silhouette illustration by Erik Nelson Rodriguez." alt1="" alt2="" %}

I explored another direction that was more clearly hand drawn with comic-inspired typography. The white lines on black were a reference to the chalkboards seen during the video scenes of the kids in their classrooms. This direction was also promising because the white lines could animate on top of video more naturally, providing a device to transition from a video scene to illustration. 

{% include inline-wide-split.html inline_img1='lastgen_stylev1_2a.jpg' inline_img2='lastgen_stylev1_2b.jpg'  alt1="" alt2="" %}

Bathymetry refers to the depth of the ocean floor. I used bathymetry data from the Marshall Islands to create a background texture with bathymetry lines for this design direction.

{% include inline-wide-split.html inline_img1='lastgen_stylev1_3a.jpg' inline_img2='lastgen_stylev1_3b.jpg'  alt1="" alt2="" %}

It was important to create a seamless experience between video and illustration so the moments that were more explanatory felt like a continuation of the narrative. Early on in our process I experimented with ways to animate the illustration on screen as a way to transition from a video scene into a graphic. 

{% include inline-col-vid.html video='lastgen_island' poster='lastgen_island.jpg' %}

I also played with adding video directly to illustration.

{% include inline-col-vid.html video='lastgen_flood' poster='lastgen_flood.jpg' %}

After an iterative process of design reviews and making tweaks our team was leaning in the direction that used photographic textures combined with black silhouette illustrations. However, I did want to give the hand-drawn direction with white lines one last shot. I attempted this direction in a style that was more sophisticated rather than childlike.

{% include inline-col-8.html inline_img='lastgen_islandill.jpg' alt='' %}

It was a worthwhile exploration but it still did not feel right. So, we decided to present two final design directions to our executive producer: One that was based on textures and black silhouette illustrations. And another that was a cleaner and more minimal approach, a direction that would be more typical and safe for the FRONTLINE brand.

{% include inline-wide-split.html inline_img1='lastgen_stylea.jpg' inline_img2='lastgen_styleb.jpg' caption="Wilmer silhouette illustration by Erik Nelson Rodriguez." alt1="" alt2="" %}

Our executive producer chose the direction that our team was the most excited about, the one with textures and black silhouettes. This direction also gave us a very natural way to tie everything together with a visual device. I could use the black silhouette style for illustrated moments and as a black background behind text during video scenes.

I looked at different typographic palettes as the illustration and design direction evolved. What began as a search through heavily comic-inspired type ended in a direction that was cleaner yet still with a slight hand drawn feel.

I knew that the typographic system needed to work for different display contexts: I needed a headline typeface with some personality to be used for the main title and sections, text that would communicate the main story in our narrative voice, and a workhorse typeface for subtitles, graphic labels and interface elements. I chose three typefaces that have some similar characteristics between them so they feel connected, but they're each uniquely suited for their purpose in the system and distinct from one another. 

Naive Line Sans is hand-drawn yet still feels clean and elegant due to its lighter weight, condensed width and consistent strokes. This type works well to display the main title of the project and acts as a major branding element.

{% include inline-col.html inline_img='lastgen_naive.png' alt='' %}

I chose Karma for the narration text—the main text that communicates the story in FRONTLINE's voice. Karma clearly stands out with its serifs. This distinction works well to let the viewer know that the story is continuing. Karma has slightly rounded serifs and a hint of a brush stroke, which provides a hand-drawn connection to the title typeface above. 

{% include inline-col.html inline_img='lastgen_karma.png' alt='' %}

Barlow feels more utilitarian so it works well for interface elements and informational text. However, it does have rounded corners that give it a softer feel and help it fit within this system of typefaces that all have some organic characteristics.

{% include inline-col.html inline_img='lastgen_barlow.png' alt='' %}

The typography felt more natural overall when paired with a textured background so I used a canvas brush texture throughout the experience. This gives all the screens a softer, organic feel and helps connect the illustration, video and typography. The color palette features a dominant blue with other desaturated colors pulled from video scenes.

## The Graphics

The graphic sections explain the science behind climate change concepts in each chapter. They have a common aesthetic—using black silhouette illustrations and photographic textures—but each one is unique and set in an abstracted environment inspired by the previous video scene. This helps connect the graphic section with the video scene and allows the story to continue in a more fluid way.

The first explanatory graphic section is about the effects of sea level rise. This graphic comes after a video scene of kids in a classroom making drawings about climate change. So, the illustration continues that context by starting off with a kid's drawing. Here, we see an illustrated view of how Izerman is thinking about ice melting and sea level rise.

{% include inline-col.html inline_img='lastgen_slr_draw.jpg' alt='' %}

The scene transitions to a side view of an island. I incorporated a graph paper texture here in the water to continue the reference to the classroom.

{% include inline-wide.html inline_img='slr_wide.jpg' alt='' %}

The background of the scene is a video with animated trees and water. The scene changes as the user moves through different steps. 

{% include inline-col-vid.html video='lastgen_slr_trees' poster='lastgen_slr_trees.jpg' %}

Waves are layered on top as a separate element and are animated with CSS. We explain that rising seas cause increased flooding on the islands. The frequent flooding could force residents to move away even before the seas would rise up over the island. [explain better and go back to the experience again]

{% include inline-col.html inline_img='lastgen_slr_waves.jpg' alt='' %}

Julia's story involves the relationship between the United States and the Marshall Islands and the history of nuclear testing there. Julia's family is from Bikini, which was bomed in the 1940s and 1950s along with another nearby island. The residents were evacuated at the time, but drifting radiation caused people on nearby islands to get sick [check this]. Bikini has been unsafe to live on since then. Julia lives on another island called Majuro, the most populated one in the Marshall Islands, where Izerman and Wilmer also live.

We wanted our audience to experience the lasting impact that this nuclear testing had on the Marshall Islands. Even looking at the raw data was startling, so we decided that simply visualizing the size and number of bombs would be the most impactful.

I started sketching out the data. First I plotted circles along a timeline. The circle area reflects the energy yield of each bomb. Here, they're plotted at their exact date on the timeline. There were two islands where the bombings took place, so I separated those into two rows.

{% include inline-col.html inline_img='lastgen_bombs_circles1.png' alt='' %}

The bombings were clustered together in certain years. This was the most accurate picture of what happened but it wasn't that effective because many of the circles were overlapping—you couldn't really sea how many there were.

Next I plotted the circles equally spaced apart in a row, which distorts the time scale. This made it feel much more impactful. You can see all the indivual bombs more clearly. Our team decided that the distortion of the time scale was editorially acceptable since the exact dates were not that important, were were mainly trying to emphasize the size and overall number of bombs.

{% include inline-col.html inline_img='lastgen_bombs_circles2.png' alt='' %}

Separating the islands into two rows added unnecessary complexity. A single row of bombs was a cleaner presentation and would have a greater impact. 

{% include inline-col.html inline_img='lastgen_bombs_circles3.png' alt='' %}

I added a subtle map of the islands in the background of the final graphic scene, as the bombs animate on screen the island lights up where the bombing happened. The user advances through the graphic scene, each swipe or tap drops a years worth of bombs at a time.

{% include inline-col-8.html inline_img='lastgen_bombs.jpg' alt='' %}

Also in Julia's section of the story, she talks about climate change by referencing the emissions from gas powered boats. We used her description as an animated transition moment. 

{% include inline-col-vid.html video='lastgen_co2_intro' poster='lastgen_co2_intro.jpg' %}

An illustrated boat rides across the waves while realistic exhaust billows from the top. This combination of illustration, photographic textures and animation is the effect we were trying to achieve throughout the graphic sections—it continues the immersive feeling of the the video scene and transitions into a data presentation. The boat passes across the screen and reveals a chart comparing the history of CO2 emissions to sea level rise.

{% include inline-col-8.html inline_img='lastgen_co2.jpg' alt='' %}

[EDIT THIS PARAGRAPH AGAIN] In Wilmer's chapter we walk through sea level rise projections through the end of this century. Our team examined the data closely and interviewed experts responsible for putting the projections together. These projections are based on different CO2 emission scenarios—more emissions means a higher global temperature rise and a higher sea level [CHECK THIS]. I started to sketch out the data for these projections and matched them up with a threshold for flooding on the Marshall Islands. This sea level threshold is the height that would likely result in flooding too frequent to sustain normal life on the islands [CHECK THIS]. Based on this threshold and the projections, we were able to determine the likely amount of years left that the people of the Marshall Islands had to live there. 

{% include inline-col.html inline_img='lastgen_projections_charts.png' class="topbtm-border" alt='' %}

These charts are difficult to interpret even with a lot of hand holding. We decided to take a different approach and simply emphasize the number of years that the kids have left.

[EDIT AGAIN] The emissions scenarios are determined in part by the agreement made at the Paris climate accord [TITLE CASE?] in 2015. And our graphic section follows a video scene from the conference, so we continued this scene into an abstracted version of the conference to display the sea level projections.

{% include inline-col-8.html inline_img='lastgen_projections.jpg' alt='' %}

[WRAP UP STILL TO WRITE] Tie the projections back to the title and the overall story of the kids and their time left on the island. Then back up to talk about the visual design and experience decisions and how it all combines into an innovative experience that tells the kids story in a unique way.
