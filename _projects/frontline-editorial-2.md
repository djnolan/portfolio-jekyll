What follows is a small collection of editorial projects from the spring of 2016 through the spring of 2017. These stories follow a longform scrolling template but have custom designed elements: layout, typography, maps and charts. I worked on the user experience, the visual design and the HTML and CSS. 

## Guantanamo's "Forever Prisoners"

{% include inline-wide-split.html inline_img1='gitmo_cover.jpg' inline_img2='gitmo_detainees.jpg' class1='border' class2='border' alt1="Layout and hero image design for How 30 Forever Prisoners Got Out of Gitmo" alt2="Web page layout showing thumbnail images of some of the forever prisoners." %}

[How 30 "Forever Prisoners" Got Out of Gitmo](http://apps.frontline.org/how-30-forever-prisoners-got-out-of-gitmo/): We used simple charts combined with scrolling text to show what happened to the 240 Guantanamo prisoners reviewed during Barack Obama's presidency. The story focuses on 30 prisoners who were initially deemed too dangerous to transfer but then later released. We look at who these 30 prisoners are, why they were released and where they went.

## The New Militias

{% include inline-wide-split.html inline_img1='militias_quote.jpg' inline_img2='militias_charts.jpg' class1='border' class2='border' alt1="Web page layout for A Guide to the New Militia Movement showing the leader of the founder of the Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes" alt2="Web page layout for A Guide to the New Militia Movement showing charts about the number of militia groups over time." %}

[A Guide to the New Militia Movement](http://apps.frontline.org/militia-movement/): An explainer that tracks the history of organized militias over the last few decades. We focus on the groups that make up today's modern patriot movement. We use stripped-down line charts to show trends in the number of militia groups over time.

## To Catch a Terrorist

{% include inline-wide-split.html inline_img1='terrorist_cover.jpg' inline_img2='terrorist_layout.jpg' class1='border' class2='border' alt1="Cover image for To Catch a Terrorist showing a close up of a candlelight vigil." alt2="Web page layout and design from To Catch a Terrorist showing map designs." %}

[To Catch a Terrorist](http://apps.frontline.org/to-catch-a-terrorist/): A unique and detailed personal story that traces one man's involvement with members of islamic extremist groups. We look at how this man was apprehended by police and then prosecuted under France's terrorism laws.

## Affiliates of ISIS

{% include inline-wide-split.html inline_img1='isis_layout.jpg' inline_img2='isis_chart.jpg' class1='border' class2='border' alt1="Layout and design of Where the Black Flag of ISIS Flies showing a map of attacks in Saudi Arabia and a lead image treatment." alt2="A chart from Where the Black Flag of ISIS Flies showing where ISIS foreign fighters are from." %}

[Where the Black Flag of ISIS Flies](http://apps.frontline.org/isis-affiliates/): A detailed scrolling explainer that outlines the different countries where ISIS has affiliate groups.
