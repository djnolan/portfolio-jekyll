Intro text, pushed for a simple solution for Plum Landing logo, and I lost that battle. The executive producers wanted the logo to convey all the important things that the project was about, and they wanted it to include the main character. So I ended up with an earth and the main character, Plum, on top. And there's an arrow going around the earth to represent the kids travelling to different places around the world. Yes, it's very literal and pretty complex for a logo, but I think it turned out well and has held up nicely in various applications.
