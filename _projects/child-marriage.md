FRONTLINE reporter [Anjali Tsui](https://twitter.com/anjalitsui?lang=en) followed child marriage in the U.S. for over a year: collecting data, uncovering personal stories and researching the legal landscape in each state. Anjali worked collaboratively with the FRONTLINE digital team to create stories and experiences for our website and social media. I focused on the data driven story and on an animated explainer made for facebook.

[Child Marriage in America: By the Numbers](http://apps.frontline.org/child-marriage-by-the-numbers/)—our data story draws from 16 years of underage marriage data (2000–2015) and 41 states. We aimed to create a full picture of the problem of underage marriage in this country. We break down the national numbers by different categories like age and gender and we go into further detail, looking at the numbers and trends in each state.

Most of the charts that show the national numbers are based on simple percentages. I wanted the data in the charts to feel more personal: not just like abstract numbers but that real children were being affected by this. I chose a design that uses simplified child icons to express percentages, and I went with a palette that feels more feminine: hinting at the fact that this problem affects largely underrage girls.

One of our challenges was to strike a balance between showing that the problem exists in this country and has affected kids as young as 10 years old, while at the same time showing that most of the minors that married were 16 and 17 and that the numbers overall have been decreasing steadily over time.

The story ends with a complete list of state cards that show the numbers and laws affecting child marriage in each state.

## Animated Explainer

With direction from the FRONTLINE digital video team, I created an [animated explainer](https://www.facebook.com/frontline/videos/10154611790576641/) based on the same data and content as our web article. This motion graphics piece was designed specifically for our facebook audience: it's short and to the point and in a square aspect ratio. I redesigned the charts and graphics to work better in an animated environment. The charts were simplified into circular bar graphs that can be read and understood quickly.

Our challenge was to communicate most of the data in a short time while not overwhelming people with numbers. The choreography and variation throughout helps keep the pacing and move the story along.
