In 2015, I worked on the redesign of the FRONTLINE website with a team at WGBH Digital. FRONTLINE is the PBS documentary series, and they publish all the films along with text-based and interactive journalism. 

I was the lead designer on the project, responsible for the visual design and user experience. Our goals were these: Give the site a visual refresh so it falls more in line with a fresh vision for the FRONTLINE brand. Make it responsive, of course, and optimize the reading and watching experience for mobile. And design to accommodate some unique editorial and publishing processes. 

Early on our team worked together to gather user research based on site analytics and a user survey of the existing FRONTLINE audience. We then created user personas and scenarios so we could start to craft our initial solutions to target these specific audiences and use cases. For example, we wanted to target a younger audience coming to our site from facebook that was possibly unfamiliar with FRONTLINE. How could we engage them with a single piece of reporting and then introduce them to a vast archive of investigative journalism in video and text form? It's scenarios like these that helped shape our initial process and keep the design solutions focused.

## Concept

The FRONTLINE editorial team had specific needs around publishing content. They needed article templates that could accommodate both shorter, quick-hit stories and longer investigative pieces. They wanted to curate and bundle content around film topics. And they had a sometimes infrequent publishing schedule, different from the day-to-day churn of a daily news site. 

My approach: sketch out a loose system of flexible components based on these needs. Our team could then work together to iron out the details of the components and then assemble them together into page templates. All the pages on the site would simply be different configurations of components pulled from the same library.

We cut these component sketches out individually and started assembling them into pages. This formed the basis of the site and helped the team get on board with the idea of a website as a system of components and templates. 

Alongside this work our team also began a phase of content strategy that started with an inventory of existing content types. This allowed us to start making decisions around which types of content to prioritize for the redesign and what could be left behind in a legacy format. 

## Wireframes and Prototypes

The success of the paper components lead me to propose a similarly flexible and collaborative method for wireframing. I created rough, responsive html wireframes of individual components. I then could easily assemble the components together in different ways to come up with template variations. All of these initial components and templates were immediately viewable on the devices of team members. We were evaluating even these early design decisions in the right context, the same context where the final website would be seen.

{% include inline-wide-fourths.html inline_img1='component_wires_1.jpg' class1='border' inline_img2='component_wires_2.jpg' class2='border' inline_img3='component_wires_3.jpg' class3='border' inline_img4='component_wires_4.jpg' class4='border' alt1='' alt2='' alt3='' alt4='' %}

Our front-end developer even created a template builder that allowed all members of the team to select components and assemble them into templates. [MAYBE DON'T NEED THIS?]

## Experience Considerations

We took a deeper look through existing user paths through the site and teased out some flows we wanted to focus on. We wanted to make sure our system of components could be arranged in such a way that it really would be engaging the users in our target scenarios and then sending them along to the right places on our site.

{% include inline-wide-split.html inline_img1='redesign_ux_1.png' inline_img2='redesign_ux_2.png'  class1='border' class2='border' alt1='' alt2='' %}

We refined our components and I created low fidelity static wireframes as a way of documenting the component with it's accompanying rules. (may need to explain what the rules are if the image does not do that)

## Visual Design

We asked the FRONTLINE team to come up with words that defined their brand, some reflective of the current brand and some aspirational. Words like courageous, trusted, cinematic, thought-provoking and even badass started to emerge. For me, these words started to become the beginnings of different visual design directions.

Our process was inspired by Brad Frost's atomic design (link). But we used a simplified structure of templates made up of components, and components made up of individual styles. This structure influenced the visual design process and would become the pieces that make up the style guide.

But firstâ€¦ typography. [KEEP GOING HERE]

{% include inline-wide-split.html inline_img1='redesign_tile_3.jpg' inline_img2='redesign_tile_4.jpg' class1='border' class2='border' alt1='' alt2='' %}

[final font choices: show stock article, but talk about testing body fonts?]

[designing components, then checking them in comps]
[global nav and footer, thumbnail and slider component example from comps]

{% include inline-col.html class='topbtm-border' inline_img='redesign_components.jpg' alt="" %}

{% include inline-col.html inline_img='redesign_nav.jpg' alt="" %}

{% include inline-col.html inline_img='redesign_footer.jpg' alt="" %}
[we could lose all three of those?]

[components formed into final styleguide, made final development much easier]

{% include inline-wide.html inline_img='redesign_styleguide.jpg' alt='' %}

[film page with mobile example]

{% include inline-wide-split.html inline_img1='redesign_film.jpg' inline_img2='redesign_film_m.jpg' width='thin' class='mobile' class1='border' class2='border' alt1='' alt2='' %}

[homepage cover]
