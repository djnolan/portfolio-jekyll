I spent most of 2015 leading the redesign of the [FRONTLINE website](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/). Since then, I joined the FRONTLINE staff full time and have been designing stories and interactive features on the digital team alongside reporters and technologists. It's been nearly a year of working through how a user should experience topics like ISIS, opioids and the Syrian war. I've collected a few smaller projects here that I didn't include elsewhere on their own.


## The Israel / U.S. Relationship

[The Highs and Lows of the "Special Relationship"](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/the-highs-and-lows-of-the-special-relationship/) is an article about the historical relationships between U.S. presidents and Israeli prime ministers. Dueling images are used to display the leaders and highlight a moment in their relationship as one of "strain" or "solidarity".

## Health Supplements

[Are Health Supplements Too Much of a Good Thing?](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/are-health-supplements-too-much-of-a-good-thing/) This article and interactive examines popular over-the-counter vitamin supplements. We looked at how much the dosage amount compares to the recommended daily value and how much food it takes to equal that dosage. I worked on the user experience, visual design, illustration and HTML/CSS.

## The Opioid Crisis

[How Bad is the Opioid Epidemic?](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/how-bad-is-the-opioid-epidemic/) The goal of this piece was to communicate just how big and how deadly the opioid crisis has become. I took the lead in researching the mortality data and in shaping the story that became an article with embedded charts and graphics.

## Children of Syria
