I spent most of 2015 leading the redesign of the [FRONTLINE website](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/). Since then, I joined the FRONTLINE staff full time and have been designing stories and interactive features on the digital team alongside reporters and technologists. It's been nearly a year of working through how a user should experience topics like ISIS, opioids and the Syrian war. I've collected a few smaller projects here that I didn't include elsewhere on their own.


## The Israel / U.S. Relationship
{% include inline-col.html inline_img='israel2.jpg' class='border' alt='Web page screenshot showing the design of a feature about Israeli-U.S. relations.' %}
[The Highs and Lows of the "Special Relationship"](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/the-highs-and-lows-of-the-special-relationship/) is an article about the historical relationships between U.S. presidents and Israeli prime ministers. Dueling images are used to display the leaders and highlight a moment in their relationship as one of "strain" or "solidarity".

## Health Supplements

[Are Health Supplements Too Much of a Good Thing?](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/are-health-supplements-too-much-of-a-good-thing/) This article and interactive examines popular over-the-counter vitamin supplements. We looked at how much the dosage amount compares to the recommended daily value and how much food it takes to equal that dosage. I worked on the user experience, visual design, illustration and HTML/CSS.

## The Opioid Crisis
{% include inline-col.html inline_img='heroin_data_art.jpg' alt='Pattern illustration of pill bottles and syringes.' %}
[How Bad is the Opioid Epidemic?](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/how-bad-is-the-opioid-epidemic/) The goal of this piece was to communicate just how big and how deadly the opioid crisis has become. I took the lead in researching the mortality data and in shaping the story that became an article with embedded charts and graphics.

## Children of Syria
[Children of Syria By the Numbers](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/children-of-syria-by-the-numbers/) is a piece that examines key facts about children in Syria that have been affected by the war. I gathered statistics from UN reports and databases and translated them into a clear visual language that highlights the effects of war on the health and development of children in the region. 

{% include inline-wide-split.html inline_img1='syria_art.jpg' inline_img2='syria_numbers.jpg' alt1='Illustration showing a map of Syria with icons of children.' alt2='Charts showing statistics about children in Syria.' %}

As we do with all visual stories for FRONTLINE, the assets are converted into a graphics package for social media to engage our audience across platforms and drive traffic back to our site.
